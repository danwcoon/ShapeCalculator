This is the first project I worked on - I'm saving it to look back on later. It is a simple calculator that calculates surface area, perimeter, and volume of shapes in order to work in my function knowledge.
In addition, it was difficult for me at the moment, but I managed to write a loop that asks the user if they would like to run another calculation at the end of each calculation.
